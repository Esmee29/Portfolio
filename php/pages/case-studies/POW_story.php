            <h3 class="h2">The Problem</h3>
            <p>Despite abundant data and projects on World War II, there's a noticeable lack of representation regarding Prisoners of War (P.O.W.s). This project aims to fill this gap by creating a thematic map covering historical, political, and geographical aspects. It focuses on telling the stories of P.O.W.s like my Great-Grandfather Charles Bacon, held in Italy, Germany, and Poland during the war, to enrich our understanding of this often-overlooked part of history.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">The Solution</h3>
            <p>My Great-Grandfather Charles Bacon's experience as a Prisoner of War during the Second World War inspired me to create a booklet documenting his journey. Using his war records and family stories, I crafted a narrative that sheds light on his time in captivity. To honor the authenticity of historical records, I've incorporated redacted sections where information was missing, resembling the classified style often found in WW2 documents. This approach preserves the integrity of his story while respecting the complexities of wartime documentation.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">Kit Bag</h3>
            <p>My Great Grandfather Charles Bacon’s kit bag was the
                inspiration for the format of this project as after ﬁnding
                his kit bag the only format that made sense to me was a
                publication about him that would ﬁt inside a mini kit bag
                so I found a cotton bag, dyed it green and screen printed
                all the type that was on the original onto the mini version
                for the publication to accompany.</p>
