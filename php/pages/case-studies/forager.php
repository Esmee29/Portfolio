        <div class="case-study">
            <h3 class="h2">The Problem</h3>
            <p>Out of over 7000 edible food the global population considers only 417 food crops. Food is wasted every year, across the world, people need to become more aware of where they food comes from and how much they actually need and consume. With the cost of living crisis effecting millions of people wasting food and money isnâ€™t an option.</p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3 class="h2">The Solution</h3>
            <p>The principles of foraging are to only collect what you need so nothing goes to waste and if foraging can become more accessible then more people can save money on food and also waste less. Forager is an app and social media account which makes foraging accessible to everyone and also connecting people through foraging.</p>
