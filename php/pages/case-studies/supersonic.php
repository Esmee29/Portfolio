            <h3 class="h2">Overview</h3>
            <p>Supersonic is a conceptual app tailored for music enthusiasts, designed to ensure they never miss the concerts they crave. The app personalizes the content users see, notifies them of ticket releases to prevent missed opportunities, and even offers chances to win tickets through exciting draws. Currently available as a Figma prototype, the goal is to develop Supersonic into a fully functional coded app, providing a seamless experience for concert-goers everywhere.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">The Brief</h3>
            <p>The project aims to create a brand, product, or experience inspired by a given hip-hop lyric. The result is an app that gets users to the concerts they want to see, tailoring the content they see, notifying them of ticket releases so they don’t miss out, and providing opportunities to win tickets through exciting draws.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">Lyric</h3>
            <p>My hip-hop lyric was, “Cause this jam is just movin’ the crowd
                is steady groovin’ to a supersonic pace” and from these
                lyrics the words “crowd”, “grooving” and “supersonic” stood
                out to me. From these words and the ideas below, a ticketing
                company for music was my favourite and it ﬁts well with
                crowd and grooving.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">The Problem</h3>
            <p>Many people struggle to find concert tickets for their favorite music genres and artists. They often miss out on ticket releases due to a lack of timely information, and when they do find tickets, they are frequently too expensive.</p>

        <div class="case-study">
            <h3 class="h2">The Solution</h3>
            <p>Supersonic, the go-to app for music lovers, tailors its content to users' preferences, making it easier to find and secure concert tickets. Users can select their favorite genres, sync their streaming services, and receive timely notifications for ticket releases, ensuring they never miss the concerts they want to see. The app also helps keep ticket prices low and offers opportunities to win tickets through exciting draws.</p>

            <h3 class="h2">Logo</h3>
            <p>The logo was inspired by Supersonic booms and sound waves, and records; the main logo has the word Supersonic and the sound wave ‘s’ is for the app icon. I wanted a dark theme for the app as it is ticketing app for concerts which for the most part happen at night so I have chosen a dark background colour and pick brighter colours to compliment it. </p>
